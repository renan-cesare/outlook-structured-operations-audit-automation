# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in this project.

This repository is primarily intended as a **portfolio and reference implementation**
of a structured operations audit workflow using Outlook and Excel.

## Scope

Small improvements are welcome, such as:
- documentation refinements
- code organization
- robustness and readability improvements

Changes that require real corporate data, real email accounts,
or proprietary business rules should **not** be included.

## Data and security

- Do not include real email addresses or corporate accounts
- Do not include real Excel bases or audit data
- Use only synthetic or placeholder data when necessary
